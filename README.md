# Hello there

To give a general sense of what you will find on my GitHub, here are some opinions:
Rust is cool, Nix is amazing, Neovim is imperfect but better than the alternatives, and keyboards are a fun hobby.
If you agree with one of those statements, you are also cool. Check out my repositories!
